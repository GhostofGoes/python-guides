   Getting started with a Python 
* Python project how-to. 
Packaging, documentation, collaboration, licenses, testing, tools like Cookiecutter, changelog, etc. 
While it is not all Python-specific, I think it would be useful for a lot of people in this community, especially since it can be really overwhelming. 

Might split this into multiple guides: documentation, packaging and deployment, testing, projects.
