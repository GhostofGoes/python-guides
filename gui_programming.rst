   Everything about creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) in Python.


Introduction
============

If you want to provide an intuitive interface for your users or display 
rich visual content, then you should considor creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
for your program. There are two main classes of GUIs that are useful for Python: 
native and web. 


Native GUIs in Python
=====================

Native GUIs are what you typically think of with a desktop application: 
a window with a title, close, minimize, and maximize buttons, it's own process, 
menus, and system styling. Some examples are text editors, a calculator, or a game.

Advantages

- Don't require a browser
- Generally consume less disk space, RAM, and processing power
- Don't need to learn any new languages (pure-Python)

Disadvantages:

- Supporting multiple platforms is challenging
- 


Web-based GUIs in Python
========================

Web-based GUIs implement the graphical interface the same way as a typical 
Internet website would be created, using a standard browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Edge) 
and the standard web technologies JavaScript (JS), Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML), 
and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Unlike a website, the only user of the page is the 
end user (not anyone on the Internet), and actions generally interact directly with 
the user's system (websites are usually sandboxed).
