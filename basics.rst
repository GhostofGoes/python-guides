* Collection of non-code stuff that's nice to know and is up to date, targeted to newbies. 
Want to try to ease over the often conflicting tribal knowledge found on SO/etc., 
and platform differences (e.g. use python -m pip install --user instead of pip install or sudo -H pip install)

`python -m pip install --user`
